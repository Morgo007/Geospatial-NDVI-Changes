# Spatial-NDVI-Changes
This Jupyter Notebook analyses Landsat 8 multispectral imagery to assess vegetation changes in the Dogon Plateau region of Mali, located in the Sahel, from 2015 to 2023. It employs NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) calculations to monitor and understand geospatial vegetation dynamics over time.
